# SingleFileSelenium

SingleFileSelenium is a modified version of SingleFile that allows for saving a webpage while using Selenium to control a browser. This extension is to be used with a non-headless browser. Meaning: the regular way of controlling a browser like Firefox or Chrome. So, while controlling Firefox with Selenium, you can communicate with this extension using Selenium to modify the page contents of the webpage you want to save. Note: this is still under development and I have not yet added full functionality to allow full cooperation with Selenium. Assume that if your reading this that I have not yet fully completed this project. Once this text is removed the project will be done.

# Notice

This project is still underway and I will remove this warning once I have gotten this extension to a state where it can fully interract with the regular non-healdess version of Selenium in a reliable manner. So until this text is omitted please assume that this extension is still under its final stages of development.
